## Steps to Setup

2. Now we want you to do a bit of work too, but we won't make you code we promise.
4. Go to the Discord Developers Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications). Create an application, give it the required permissions and intents. And copy your BOT TOKEN as it will be used to deploy your BOT, you can name your bot anything and add any image.
5. Now DM Poseidon with the p!start command
Poseidon will take you forward and ask for your preferred features, your BOT TOKEN and finally will deploy your bot for you.
Enjoy the features
